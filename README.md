# CLIMS
Some stuff related to the coupled climate - ice sheet model (CLIMS):

1) The CLIMS data viewer (CLIMSdataviewer.py) can be used to view and compare data of Coupled Loveclim - ice sheet modeling system (CLIMS). To use the data viewer, save the file (CLIMSdataviewerV01.py) at a convenient location, and run it from a terminal with "python CLIMSdataviewerV01.py" You can then use the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ . Python libraries netcdf4, numpy, plotly, os, dash, dash_core_components and  dash_html_components are required. For an enhanced user experience, it is recommended to define default search paths and experiment names at the top of the file.
